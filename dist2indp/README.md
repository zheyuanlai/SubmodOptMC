# Supermodular optimization of distance to independence

We use supermodular minimization on the distance to independence of a subset Markov chain, subject to a cardinality constraint.

Minimizing a supermodular function $f$ is the same as maximizing a submodular function $-f$. Hence, we use the greedy algorithm for submodular maximization.
