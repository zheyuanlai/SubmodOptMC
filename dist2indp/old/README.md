# Supermodular optimization of distance to independence

The map $$S \mapsto \mathbb{I} (P^{(S)})$$ is monotonically non-decreasing and supermodular, so there does not exist near-optimal greedy algorithm for optimization, instead, we consider the following map
$$S \mapsto \mathbb{I} (P^{(-S)}),$$ which is monotonically non-increasing and supermodular, therefore, a greedy minimization algorithm provides a near-optimal approximation.
