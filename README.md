<summary>üìÑ Abstract</summary>
We study the problem of optimally projecting the transition matrix of a finite ergodic multivariate Markov chain onto a lower-dimensional state space. Specifically, we seek to construct a projected Markov chain that optimizes various information-theoretic criteria under cardinality constraints. These criteria include entropy rate, information-theoretic distance to factorizability, independence, and stationarity. We formulate these tasks as best subset selection problems over multivariate Markov chains and leverage the submodular (or supermodular) structure of the objective functions to develop efficient greedy-based algorithms with theoretical guarantees. We proceed to consider multivariate situations, and introduce a generalized distorted greedy algorithm for optimizing $k$-submodular functions under cardinality constraints, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we illustrate the theory and algorithms through extensive numerical experiments on multivariate Markov chains associated with the Bernoulli-Laplace and Curie-Weiss model.

## üëã Overview
We develop a framework for selecting a subset of coordinates from a multivariate Markov chain subject to some cardinality constraints. In our approach, we project the Markov chain's transition matrix onto a lower-dimensional space by choosing coordinates that optimize some information-theoretic criteria, which include entropy rate, information-theoretic distance to factorizability, independence, and stationarity. Since these maps are submodular (or supermodular) under some assumptions [2], we design greedy-based optimization algorithms with theoretical guarantees. We also perform numerical experiments on multivariate Markov chains associated with the Bernoulli-Laplace level model and the Curie-Weiss model to showcase the performance of our proposed methods.

## üî¨ Numerical Experiments
We consider the multivariate Markov chains associated with the Bernoulli-Laplace level model [7] and the Curie-Weiss model [1] (see Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 of our paper). We examine the performance of the following algorithms on both models:

* Heuristic greedy algorithm (see Section 4 of [11])
* Distorted greedy algorithm [5] (see Algorithm 2 of our paper)
* Generalized distorted greedy algorithm (see Algorithm 3 of our paper)
* Batch greedy algorithm [6] (see Algorithm 4 of our paper)

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage
To reproduce the numerical experiments presented in the manuscript:
1. Set up a new Conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n submodular python=3.10 -y
conda activate submodular
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Navigate to the relevant folder (e.g., `entropy_rate/`) and run the experiment scripts.

## üìä Results
The `results/Bernoulli-Laplace/` and `results/Curie-Weiss/` folders contain:
* Plots comparing the performance of different algorithms.
* Logs and output files from the numerical experiments.
