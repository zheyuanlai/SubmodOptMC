# Submodularity optimization of the entropy rate

We use submodularity maximization to find an optimal subset Markov chain with knapsack constraints.

To perform numerical simulation, run the main script:
```
python main.py
```


The submodularity maximization algorithms included come from Prof. Zaiwen Wen's [lecture notes](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~wenzw/bigdata/lect-submodular.pdf).
